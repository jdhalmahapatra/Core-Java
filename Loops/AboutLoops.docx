//While Loop
While loop allows code to be executed repeatedly until a condition is satisfied. 
If the number of iterations is not fixed, it is recommended to use a while loop.

Syntax:
while(condition)
{
   // Body of while loop
}

//For Loop
It is a part of a control statements. If block of codes 
needs to be executed several times, then it is better to use
For Loop.

Syntax:
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
   // Body of for loop
}

//Do While Loop
It is like a while loop, It also allows code to be executed repeatedly until a condition is satisfied. 
The only difference that it checks for the condition after the execution of the body of the loop. 

Syntax:
do
{
   // Body of loop
} While(condition);
