//If-Else Statement
If statement in Java is a simple decision-making statement. 
It is used to decide whether the statement or block of statements will be executed or not. 
Block of statements will be executed if the given condition is true otherwise the block of the statement will be skipped.

Syntax:
if(condition){
    // Statement to executed
}
else{
    //Statement to executed
}

//If-Else Ladder or if else if
if-else-if statement is always be executed from the top down. 
During the execution of conditions if any condition founds true, then the statement associated with that if it is executed, 
and the rest of the code will be skipped. 
If none of the conditions is true, then the final else statement will be executed.

Syntax:
if(condition){
    // Statement to executed
}
else if(condition){
    // Statement to executed
}
else{
    //Statement to executed
}


//Nested If Else
Nested If Else basically means an If Else statement inside another If Else statement. You often have to check sub-conditions within existing conditions.

//Switch Case
It is very similar to multiple If Else statements, 
but the only difference being that Switch case statements are strictly used only when we have to only check the value of a variable and only then take an action. 
It is recommended to use If Else statements in those situations where you might have to check some additional conditions besides the value of a single variable.

Syntax:
switch (variable/expression) {
            case value1:
                //Code to executed
                break;
            case value2:
                //Code to executed
                break;
            .
            .
            .

            default:
                break;
        }
